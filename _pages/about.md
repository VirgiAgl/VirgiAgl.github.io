I recently joined [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) as a Research Scientist! Formerly I was a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Warwick where I was supervised by Dr. Theodoros Damoulas. More information about my background can be found on my [CV](https://github.com/VirgiAgl/VirgiAgl/VirgiAgl.github.io/files/CV.pdf).


# Research Interests
My research interests are at the interface of Bayesian statistics and computer science. I am interested in developing scalable *causal* decision making frameworks based on probabilistic models. I have previously worked on machine learning algorithms for multi-task learning with Gaussian processes with a particular focus on point processes models. In terms of applications, I am interested in tackling problems in the social sciences and in healthcare.

# Projects

* I completed a summer internship (July 2020 - January 2021) within the Azua Team in the Microsoft Research Lab in Cambridge.
* I completed a summer internship at Amazon Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) group in Cambridge under the supervision of Javier Gonzalez.
* I am collaborating with the University of Sydney's Centre for Translational Data Science on Bayesian Optimisation for criminology. This is part of a broader collaboration between the Alan Turing Institute and the Centre for Translational Data Science.
* I visited CSIRO's Data61 (11/18-02/19) to work on Gaussian Process modulated Poisson Processes.
* I am a visiting researcher at the Alan Turing Institute and I am part of the Clean Air project. The project aims at developing statistical methodology and machine learning algorithms to support London's Major's office in taking data-driven/evidence based policy decisions in order to improve air quality over the city of London.
* I collaborated with CUSP London on a project aiming at assessing the impact of traffic policies on the number of accidents happening in London.
