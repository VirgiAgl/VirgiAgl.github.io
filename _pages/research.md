# Research interests

Honestly, I am interested in most things... It is a curse. However, if someone said 'ok Neil cool, but drop the BS and tell us what you're actually interested in' then I would probably give them the following curated list:

- Cats
- Cats
- Cats
- Cats
- Cats

We should mention two additional inference questions:

1. when we should intervene (i.e. run the bandit) and
2. for how long we should intervene (the length of the bandit horizon)
3. w.r.t. to $\mathcal{F}$  can we say if it is better to condition the MAB on past interventions or not -- e.g. by looking at the strange attractor.
