I give a lot of talks. Usually on a rather wide range of topics. Mostly though, to be quite honest, they are on machine
learning and robotics. 

If they are interesting enough they will appear here. As you can see though, I have yet to produce anything worthy of
the likes of Cicero and Demosthenes. Until I do, my contributions to public life will sadly be privy to but a selected few.
