You can find some of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oXki9tsAAAAJ&hl=en) and some others [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Neil_Dhir). 

It is my intention to put all of my papers here. But that has also remained a rock-solid intention for more than ten
years. Alas, until new-found enthusiasm is discovered for listing titles, we must look to Google and Research Gate for
automagically listing our blood, sweat and tears (a metaphor for academic output).
